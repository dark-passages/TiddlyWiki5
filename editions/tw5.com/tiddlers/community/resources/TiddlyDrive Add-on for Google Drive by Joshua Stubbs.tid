I made an app that lets one edit TiddlyWiki files saved in your Google drive and then saving them back automagically. The page is here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiddly-drive/oaphhjhbbabdjnpjpiliepphpmnioolo but I think you need to add it from the Google Drive web interface.

I even added an optional ability to save with ctrl + s hotkeys.

! --- End of TiddlyDrive Support ---
Thank you for using TiddlyDrive. It was a fun project to make.

Unfortunately, I am unable to continue working on the app. I am a self-supported developer and cannot keep up with the constant changes in Google's requirements and app maintenance. I wish I had the time, but even cave-dwelling programmers aren't autotrophs -- we gotta eat.

The app will still be available until Google has fully disabled it. As always, though, it is open source, so feel free to create a listing yourself.

Best wishes
Jeremy
